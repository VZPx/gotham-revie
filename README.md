# How to use
First off, this is really early alpha, as of now it currently supports logging in with a dummy WBID account. Community Challenges, Digital Camo, and Gangs aren't supported at the moment.

1. Launch the game normally through steam
2. Launch Cheat Engine, and look for this string "https://cls.psn.turbine.com/cls"
3. Replace the string with "http://127.0.0.1:8080/CLS
4. Once you're in the main menu you should be logged into WBID, showing it as 'WBID Active' with a green light.
